## Features

### :white_check_mark: Working Mechanics 



### :dart: Goals 

While most features of my game do work, I do still find myself unsatisified by some features that I was not able to implement earlier. These goals include:
* Implementing proper art assets into my game 
* 

## :red_circle: Major/Minor issues during Development

Throughout my project, I ran into a variety of issues that would provide a challenge to me. While most of these issues are fairly minor, there are a few outliers that may need further evaluation at a later time. These issues include:
* Flying enemies - While the enemy would use the prefab provided, it would later erase itself and not be able to generate another projectile, which gave me a wide plethora of console issues.
* Implementing sprites - I had to completely avoid using some of my assets provided as animation sprites for the same character were of different sizes, showing the full sprite sheet png when the animation would show.
